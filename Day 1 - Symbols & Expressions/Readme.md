# ðŸ“˜ Day 1: Introduction to Algebra â€“ Symbols & Expressions

Welcome to **Day 1** of my **30-Day Algebra in Python Challenge**!  
Today I took my first step into symbolic algebra using the `SymPy` library.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- How to declare variables (called **symbols**) using SymPy
- How to create basic algebraic **expressions**
- How to **add**, **multiply**, and **evaluate** expressions
- How to **expand** powers like `(x + 1)^2`

This challenge is perfect for building a math foundation with Python.
